# AWS CDK App Sample
Use the AWS CDK to define your cloud resources in a familiar programming language. The AWS CDK supports TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Java, and C#. Developers can use one of the supported programming languages to define reusable cloud components known as Constructs. You compose these together into Stacks and Apps. 

## Resources created in this sample
Amazon S3 Bucket with versioning enabled and SSE enabled with Customer Managed CMK. Future updates to include additional resources.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

 * `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
 * `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
 * `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
